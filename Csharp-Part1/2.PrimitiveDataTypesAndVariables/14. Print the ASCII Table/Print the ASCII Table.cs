//Problem 14.* Print the ASCII Table
//
//    Find online more information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a program that prints the entire ASCII table of characters on the console (characters from 0 to 255).
//
//Note: Some characters have a special purpose and will not be displayed as expected. You may skip them or display them differently.
//
//Note: You may need to use for-loops (learn in Internet how).
