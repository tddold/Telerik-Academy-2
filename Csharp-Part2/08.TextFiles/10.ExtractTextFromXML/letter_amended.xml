  Dear Daniel,
  Thank you for sending us the information on SDL Trados Studio 2009. 
  We like your products and think they certainly represent the most powerful translation solution on the market. 
  We especially like the XML Parser rules options in the 
  XML filter. It has helped us to set up support for our XML files in a flash.
  We have already downloaded the latest version from your Customer Center.
